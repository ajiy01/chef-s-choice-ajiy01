# Chef's Choice üë©‚Äçüç≥

## TL;DR

Pick a dataset, any dataset‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and do something with it. More details below.

## Project Brief

This project will consist of an analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered so far in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. At a minimum your project should include the following elements:

1. A brief introduction to the dataset (**including its source**).
2. A clear statement defining your research question(s).
3. Exploratory data analysis.
4. A discussion of your conclusions based on your analysis.

You will need to communicate the elements in **both** of the following two deliverables:

1. A report (.pdf, or .html) **OR** ioslides generated from an R Markdown document. Your report (or slides) should include a brief introduction to the dataset, your research question(s), your methodology, and your conclusions.
2. A short (5-10 min) video presentation of your analysis. Your presentation should include a brief introduction to the dataset, your research question(s), your methodology, and your conclusions.

Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned (and you can use techniques we haven‚Äôt officially covered in class, if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous). Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.

The project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but sticking to packages we learned in class (tidyverse) is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R.

## Data

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose an appropriate dataset. A dataset with fewer than 50 observations or only a small (<5) number variables will not be large enough to perform an analysis that demonstrates your proficiency in R. Conversely, GitHub has a maximum file size restriction of 100 MB so a dataset too large could add technical burden to your project without enhancing your analysis. The dataset‚Äôs variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.

_Note: Avoid reusing datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class._

Below are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. You‚Äôre not limited to these resources, and in fact you‚Äôre encouraged to venture beyond them. But you might find something interesting there:

- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
- [DATA.GOV](https://www.data.gov/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/)
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
- [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)

## Logistics

All analyses must be done in R Studio, using R. You must submit all project files via GitHub. The only exception is the recorded presentation, which should be uploaded to Canvas ([upload instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-a-media-file-as-an-assignment-submission/ta-p/279)). Your report (or slides) must be reproducible, meaning that I must be able to generate the report (or slides) from an R Markdown file in your GitHub repository without any errors.

### Grading

Points for your project will be:

- Introduction to dataset and definition of research question (10 pts)
- Data wrangling (10 pts)
- Exploratory data analysis (30 pts)
- Final Report or Slides (20 pts)
- Video presentation (20 pts)
- Reproducibility and organization (10 pts)

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are neat and easy to read.

### Tips

Review the marking guidelines and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.

When you‚Äôre done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you‚Äôre happy with the final state of your work. Then go get some rest! üò¥
